Overview
========

This directory stores Stanford's theming files for its edX instances.
We're storing the stuff here and then pulling it in to our instance
when we deploy.

Each theme is organized in a tree to mimic the directory structure of the edX
codebase so that it's easy to tell where the files will end up upon
deploy.

The Cardinal red header and footer follow Stanfordâ€™s guidelines from:
https://identity.stanford.edu/web-mobile.html

With the specific CSS from this file:
